Warning : The variant range of wire parameters is too large. [PHYS-12]
        : The variant range (0.14, 1.6) of 'MINSPACING' for layers 'met2' and 'met5' is too large.
Warning : None of the loaded LEF files have MACRO statements. [PHYS-20]
        : Make sure the LEF file containing MACRO statement was not missed.
        : The LEF file containing the cell specific information was not loaded. The LEF MACRO construct is used to set the physical data on cells in the timing library. It is likely that only the technology LEF file was loaded. Load all the associated LEF files.
